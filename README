These are some small scripts I use to allow automatic repository creation.

The service in the backend dir runs on the server where cgit and gitolite
are installed. It will add repositories as it receives them via XMLRPC.

For the frontend, there is a single page HTML file which uses the XMLRPC
to create repositories. For that purpose, I serve the file in the frontend
dir on /create and proxy /create/api to the backend service.
